# Frankfurter

A dart library to use the [Frankfurter currency conversion service](https://www.frankfurter.app).

Frankfurter is an open source API that uses the European Central Bank to update
currency conversion rates on a regular basis and exposes these rates through
a simple API.

By default this library uses the `https://www.frankfurter.app` API, but you can
deploy your own instance of Frankfurter and connect to that instead.
